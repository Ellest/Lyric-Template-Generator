Cuttin' me up like a knife
And I feel it, deep in my bones
Kicking a habit
I love even harder
You oughta know?I just wanna dive in the water, with you
Baby, we can't see the bottom
It's so easy to fall for each other
I'm just hoping we catch one anotherOh na na, just be careful, na na
Love ain't simple, na na
Promise me no promises
Oh na na, just be careful, na na
Love ain't simple, na na
Promise me no promisesBaby, I think about you
And I feel it, deep in my heart
Maybe we just ain't meant to be something
Maybe we are?I just wanna dive in the water, with you
Baby, we can't see the bottom
It's so easy to fall for each other
I'm just hoping we catch one anotherOh na na, just be careful, na na
Love ain't simple, na na
Promise me no promises
Oh na na, just be careful, na na
Love ain't simple, na na
Promise me no promisesI just wanna dive in the water
Oh baby, we can't see the bottom
I just want to dive in with you
I just want to lie here with youOh na na, just be careful, na na
Love ain't simple, na na
Promise me no promises
Oh na na, just be careful, na na
Love ain't simple, na na
Promise me no promises
Promise me no promises
