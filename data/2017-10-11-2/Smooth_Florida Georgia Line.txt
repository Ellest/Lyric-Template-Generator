Home, home, home, home
Home, home, home, homeSmooth
Like a Tennessee Walker
Just a walking on the water
You're smooth
Like a Sunday morning Elvis
Singing Gospel it's a hell of a
Groove
Like the lines on her Mercury
Girl you're put together perfectly
Good lord almighty
Girl, you go down good
You ain't even trying
Cause you wrote the book
There ain't nobodyThat do me like you
The way you move that body
Girl, you're so smoothLike cat daddy driving
A Caddy from Cali baby
You're smooth
Like young love buzzingOff an old can bottle by the
Moon
Blackberry jam, finger-licking
Off your hand flying out the windowGood lord almighty
Girl, you go down good
You ain't even trying
Cause you wrote the book
There ain't nobody
(There ain't nobody)
That do me like you
(Do me like you)The way you move that body
(The way you move that body)
Girl, you're so smooth(You so smooth)
Smooth, smoothYou're a stroke on the canvas
A brick road to Kansas
My little summer time jamGood lord almighty
Girl, you go down good
You ain't even trying
Cause you wrote the book
There ain't nobody
(There ain't nobody)
That do me like you
(Do me like you)
The way you move that body
(The way you move that body)
Girl, you're so smooth
(You so smooth)
Smooth, smooth
(You so smooth)
Smooth
