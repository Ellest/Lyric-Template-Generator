Well it's hotter than hell outside right now
It's a 100 in the shade with the sun beatin' down
Forecast callin' for some more of the same
Well I can't fix that
But I can fix a drinkI turn on Fox News and then CNN
But it's the same dang thing all over again
The world's in the toilet and the market's in the tank
Well I can't fix thatNo, but I can fix a drink, pour it on ice
Mix it on up and get you feeling right
I can get you buzzed, I can get you smilin'
I can make you feel like you're sittin' on an island
I can make it fruity or I can make it strong
All you gotta do is tell me what you want
Put it to your lips, take a little sip
And tell me what you think
Yeah, I can fix a drinkYou say you gotta broken phone and a broken heart
Your boss is on your back and your truck won't start
None of your friends wanna listen to Hank
Well I can't fix thatNo, but I can fix a drink, pour it on ice
Mix it on up and get you feeling right
I can get you buzzed, I can get you smilin'
I can make you feel like you're sittin' on an island
I can make it fruity or I can make it strong
All you gotta do is tell me what you want
Put it to your lips, take a little sip
And tell me what you think
Yeah, I can fix a drinkI don't know what's going on with you
But if you've got some cheap whiskey and some Mountain Dew
Malibu, Cuervo, Coke in a cup
Brother I can hook you upI can fix a drink, pour it on ice
Mix it on up and get you feeling right
I can get you buzzed, I can get you smilin'
I can make you feel like you're sittin' on an island
I can make it fruity or I can make it strong
All you gotta do is tell me what you want
Put it to your lips, take a little sip
And tell me what you think
Yeah, I can fix a drink
Yeah, I can fix a drink
