I wonder if Jack and Diane ever made it,
After the drums and the guitars all faded.
Was the best they could do good enough
Or did the heartland just swallow em upHow did my mom and my dad ever do it,
If there were troubles then we never knew it.
I guess they had each other and that was enoughYou know you can't keep the ground from shakingNo matter how hard you try
You can't keep the sunsets from fading
You gotta treat you love like
Your jumping off a rope swing maybe cause the whole thing is really just a shot in the dark
You gotta love like there's no such thing as a broken heart
You gotta love like there's no such thing as a broken heartWhat am I gonna tell my kids when they see
All of this bullshit that goes down on TV
When the whole world is down on its luck
I gotta make sure they keep that chin upCry when it hurts, laugh when it's funny
Chase after the dream don't chase after the money
And know we got each other, that's whats upCause you can't keep the ground from shaking,
No matter how hard you try
You can't keep the sunsets from fading
You gotta treat you love like
Your jumping off a rope swing maybe cause the whole thing is really just a shot in the dark
You gotta love like there's no such thing as a broken heart
You gotta love like there's no such thing as a broken heartYou gotta love like there's no such thing as a broken heartCause you can't keep the ground from shaking
No matter how hard you try
You can't keep the sunsets from fading
You gotta treat you love like
Your jumping off a rope swing maybe cause the whole thing is really just a shot in the dark
You gotta love like there's no such thing as a broken heart
You gotta love love love love...
You gotta love love love love...
You gotta love like there's no such thing as a broken heart
