I don't like your little games
Don't like your tilted stage
The role you made me play
Of the fool
No, I don't like youI don't like your perfect crime
How you laugh when you lie
You said the gun was mine
Isn't cool
No, I don't like you (Oh)But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me, oohOh! Look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me doI don't like your kingdom keys
They once belonged to me
You asked me for a place to sleep
Locked me out and threw a feast (What?!)The world moves on, another day, another drama, drama
But not for me, not for me, all I think about is karma
And then the world moves on, but one thing's for sure
Maybe I got mine, but you'll all get yoursBut I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me, oohOh! Look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me doI don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreamsI don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreamsI'm sorry, but the old Taylor can't come to the phone right now
Why?
Oh, 'cause she's dead!
Oh!Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me, oohOh! Look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me doOh! Look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me, oohOh! Look what you made me do
