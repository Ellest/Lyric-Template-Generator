They call us a two lane just passing by slow down town
Yeah they say what's there to do when you ain't got nothin' around
Just a few street lights, speed limit signs that all say 25
But those folks ain't lived in our livesThey ain't seen the blood sweat and tears it took to live their dream
When everything's on the line
Ain't just another field just another farm
No it's the ground we grew up on
They think it's a middle of nowhere place where we take it slow
Aw but they don't knowAll they see is tractors, barbwire and tall green grass
They don't see the years spent working, busting their ass
How they pray for rain
They don't know a thing
About what it takes
Livin' this wayThey ain't seen the blood sweat and tears it took to live their dream
When everything's on the line
Ain't just another field just another farm
No it's the ground we grew up on
They think it's a middle of nowhere place where we take it slow
Aw but they don't knowThey call us a two lane just passing by slow down town
Yeah they say what's there to do when you ain't got nothin' aroundThey ain't seen the blood sweat and tears it took to live their dream
When everything's on the line
Ain't just another field just another farm
No it's the ground we grew up on
They think it's a middle of nowhere place where we take it slow
Aw but they don't knowNo, they don't know
