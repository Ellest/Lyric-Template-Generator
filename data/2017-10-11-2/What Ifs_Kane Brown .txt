You say what if I hurt you
What if I leave you
What if I find somebody else
And I don't need you
What if this goes south
What if I mess you up
You say what if I break out
In two then what
Well I hear you girl
I feel you girl but not so fast
Before you make your mind up
I gotta askWhat if I was made for you
And you were made for me
What if this is it
What if it's meant to be
What if I ain't one of them
Fools just Playin' some game
What if I just pulled you close
What if I leaned in
And the stars line up
And it's our last first kiss
What if one of these days baby
I'd go and change your name
What if
I loved all these what ifs awayWhat if the sky falls
(sky falls)
Or the sun stops burning
We could worry about them
What ifs 'til the world stops turnin'
Or I could kiss you
What if you liked it
(bet I'd like it)
Well we ain't
Never gonna know unless we try it
What if I was made for you
And you were made for meWhat if this is it
What if it's meant to be
What if I ain't one of them
Fools just Playin' some game
What if I just pulled you close
What if I leaned in
And the stars line up
And it's our last first kiss
What if one of these days baby
I'd go and change your name
What if I loved all
These what ifs awayAwe yeah
C'monYou say what if I hurt you
What if I leave you
What if I find somebody else and
I don't need you
DamnWhat if I was made for you
And you were made for me
What if this is it
What if it's meant to beWhat if I ain't one of them
Fools just Playin' some game
Yeah
What if I just pulled you close
What if I leaned in
And the stars line up and
It's our last first kiss
What if one of these days baby
I'd go and change your name
What if I loved all these
What is awayAway
(away)
What if?
