Girl, it's high time, I tell ya
No more messing around
Time to lay these cards on the table
And just throw it on outI'm talking you and me with the same street name
Same last name, same everything
It's a real thing, a how I feel thing
So I'ma go on and take a swingYou'll find the spot and I'll find the money
You'll be the pretty and I'll be the funny
You'll plant the flowers, I'll plant the kisses
Baby, let's get right down to businessI'll hang the pictures, you'll hang the stars
You'll pick the paint, I'll pick a guitar
Sing you a song out there with the crickets and the frogs
You'll name the babies and I'll name the dogs, yeahYou can park your car in the driveway
I'll park my truck in the grass
I'll put a little swing on the front porch
If you put a little tea in my glassWatch the sun set from a gravel road
Kiss me in the kitchen on your tippy toes
Still loving on you when the rooster crows
Watching way more than the garden growYou'll find the spot and I'll find the money
You'll be the pretty and I'll be the funny
You'll plant the flowers, I'll plant the kisses
Baby, let's get right down to businessI'll hang the pictures, you'll hang the stars
You'll pick the paint, I'll pick a guitar
Sing you a song out there with the crickets and the frogs
You'll name the babies and I'll name the dogsYeah, laying next to you every night
Sounds like a damn good lifeYou'll find the spot and I'll find the money
You'll be the pretty and I'll be the funny
You'll plant the flowers, I'll plant the kisses
Baby, let's get right down to businessI'll hang the pictures, you'll hang the stars
You'll pick the paint, I'll pick a guitar
Sing you a song out there with the crickets and the frogs
You'll name the babies and I'll name the dogs
Yeah, I'll name the dogs
You'll name the babies and I'll name the dogs
Yeah, I'll name the dogs
