It's not good enough for me, since I been with you
It's not gonna work for you, nobody can equal me (I know)
I'm gonna sip on this drink, when I'm fucked up
I should know how to pick up
I'm gonna catch the rhythm while she push up against me
Ooh, was she tipsy
I had enough convo for 24
I peeped you from across the room
Pretty little body, dancing like GoGo, ayeAnd you are unforgettable
I need to get you alone
Why not?
A fucking good time, never hurt nobody
I got a little drink but it's not Bacardi
If you loved the girl then I'm so, so sorry
I got to give it to her like we in a marriageOh, like we in a hurry
No, no, I won't tell nobody
You're on your level too
Tryna do what lovers doFeelin' like I'm fresh out, Boosie
If they want the drama, got the Uzi
Ship the whole crew to the cruise ship
Doin' shit you don't even see in movies
Ride with me, ride with me, boss
I got a hard head but her ass soft
She want the last name with the ring on it
'Cause I pulled out a million cash,
Told her plank on itAnd you are unforgettable
I need to get you aloneNow you wanna choose
Just pop the bubbly in the 'cuziIt's not good enough for me, since I been with you, ooh
I'm gonna sip on this drink, when I'm fucked up
I should know how to pick up
I'm gonna catch the rhythm while she push up against me
Ooh, was she tipsy
I had enough convo for 24
I peeped you from across the room
Pretty little body, dancing like GoGoAnd you are unforgettable
I need to get you alone
Why not?
A fucking good time, never hurt nobody

You're on your level too
Tryna do what lovers doOh oh, you ain't enough for me
Too much for you alone
Baby, go and grab some bad bitches, bring 'em home
Know the jet's on me
I'mma curve my best for you, you know
So pick up that dress for me
Leave the rest on
Too much convo 24 hours
When you stand next to 24 karats
She left her man at home
She don't love him no more
I want your mind and your body
Don't mind nobody
So, you don't ever hurt nobody
Baby girl work your body
Work your bodyAnd you are unforgettable
I need to get you aloneNow you wanna choose
Just pop the bubbly in the 'cuziWhy not?
