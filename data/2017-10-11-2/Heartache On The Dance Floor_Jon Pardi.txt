Yeah, I was just hangin' out
Some little west coast town
Found a bar out by the sand
so I made my way in
First thing that caught my eye
like nothin' I ever seenSunburned auburn hair
a California dream
Yeah, she was shakin' them hips
To some old motown song
I couldn't say a thing
so I sang alongShe was a heartache on the dance floor
(heartache on the dance floor)
Yeah, she's movin' through my mind
(movin' through my mind)
I gotta know her name and I got to see her againShe's got me wonderin'
yeah I'm just wonderin'
Where she at, where she at, where she at tonight?
Where she at, where she at, where she at tonight?
Ooh ooh ooh. YaSo I just hung around this little west coast town
I dropped by every night
I stayed till closin' time
My little mystery, that girl is killin' me
So I put on a song just to sing alongShe was a heartache on the dance floor
(heartache on the dance floor)
Yeah, she's movin' through my mind
(movin' through my mind)
I gotta know her name and I got to see her again
She's got me wonderin', yeah I'm just wonderin'Where she at, where she at, where she at tonight?
Where she at, where she at, where she at tonight?
She's got me mesmerized, she's all I'm thinkin' 'bout
All I think about, think about, think aboutSo I'm right here right now
Hummin' this little song
If I could say a thing
I'd want you to knowYou were a heartache on the dance floor
(heartache on the dance floor)
Yeah, you're movin' through my mind
(movin' through my mind)
Ooh I got to know your name and I got to see you again
And if you're listenin', listenin', listenin'
Where you at, where you at, where you at tonight?Where you at, where you at, where you at tonight?
Girl, I'm hangin' around this little town
Where you at, where you at, where you at tonight?
Where you at, where you at, where you at tonight?
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
