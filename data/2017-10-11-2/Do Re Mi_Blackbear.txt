Do re mi fa so
Yeah yeah
Do re mi fa so
YeahYeah
If I can go back to that day we met
I've probably would just stay in bed
You run your mouth all over town
And this one goes out to the sound of breaking glass on my range rover
Pay me back or bitch it's over
All the presents I would send
Fuck my friends behind my shoulder
Next time imma stay asleep
I pray the lord my soul to keepAnd you got me thinking lately
Bitch you crazy
And nothing's ever good enough
I wrote a little song for ya'
It go likeDo re mi fa so fucking done with you girl
So fucking done with all the games you play
I ain't no tic tac toe
Send the x and o's on another note I'm ghost
Do re mi fa so fucking done with you girl
So send the x and o's on another note I'm ghostIf I could go back to that day we met
I'd probably would've stayed in bed
You wake up everyday and make me feel like I'm incompetent
Designer shoes and Xanax tabs
Compliments, your makeup bag
You never had to buy yourself a drink
Cause everyone wanted to tap that ass sometimeAnd you got me thinking lately
Bitch you crazy
And nothing's ever good enough
I wrote a little song for ya'
It go likeDo re mi fa so fucking done with you girl
So fucking done with all the games you play

Send the x and o's on another note I'm ghost
