Got a girl from the Southside
Got braids in her hair
First time I seen her walk by
Man I 'Bout fell up out my chairHad to get her number
Took me like 6 weeks
Now me and her go way back
Like Cadillac seatsBody like a back road
Could drive it with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' fifteen in a thirty
I ain't in no hurry
I'm a take it slow just as fast as I canThe way she fit in them blue jeans
She don't need no belt
But I can turn 'em inside out
I don't need no helpGot hips like honey
So thick and so sweet
Ain't no curves like hers
On them downtown streetsBody like a back road
Could drive it with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' fifteen in a thirty
I ain't in no hurry
I'm a take it slow just as fast as I canWe're out here in the boondocks
With the breeze and the birds
Tangled up in the tall grass
With my lips on hersOn a highway to Heaven
Headed south of her smile
Get there when we get there
Every inch is a mileBody like a back road
Could drive it with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' fifteen in a thirty
I ain't in no hurry
I'm a take it slow just as fast as I canI'm take it slow just as fast I canGot the breeze, aah ha(Body like a back road
Could drive it with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand)
